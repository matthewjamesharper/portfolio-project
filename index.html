<article id="About-Me">
  <h4> A Bit About Myself </h4>

  <p> I've spent the better part of my adult life hopping from neighborhood to neighborhood, playing in a handful of bands, and making my way down different career paths in hopes of finding that perfect-fit job. </p>

 <p> It took a little while, but I've found a home in eCommerce and I intend to keep developing my industry-relevant repertoire of skills. It goes without saying that my time spent at Thinkful is in keeping with that pursuit. </p>
  
  <p> When I'm not at work or in school, you can find me doing the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Playing bass guitar in various live acts around the city</li>
  <li>Cooking some dope tex mex and asian-inspired cuisine</li>
  <li>Tending to my ever-growing collection of retro games</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you're looking to hire a hard-working new developer with a passion for getting it right, then I'm your guy! </p>
